Mary: Let’s move on to a more advanced skill: wall jumping between walls. It’s a little tricky, but I’ll guide you step by step.
Mary: First, walk up to the wall on the right by pressing D. Then, jump against it by pressing the Spacebar.
Mary: While you’re on the wall, press the opposite direction (A for left) and jump at the same time. This will launch you towards the other wall.
Mary: Once you reach the other wall, repeat the process: press the opposite direction and jump again. Keep going until you scale the walls.
